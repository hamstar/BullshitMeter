BullshitMeter
=============

A userscript for detecting bullshit pages dealing with political news.

**Read the Article [5 Ways to Spot a B.S. Political Story in Under 10 Seconds](http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-ways-to-spot-b.s.-political-story-in-under-10-seconds/)** to understand the motivation behind this script.

>I think there is room for a plugin or userscript that searches for the terms on news websites (and reddit/digg/etc even) and displays a bullshit logo next to titles or overlaid on the page (perhaps with a description/mouse over of why its labeled bullshit). Could also reference to this article for a full explanation of why that term was chosen.

>It would be interesting browsing through news sites and seeing how many bullshit labels come up. I'm sure they will find more words to use instead once they catch on to us, so we might need to modify the filter in future.

# The 5 ways are:

## The Headline Contains the Word "Gaffe"

* A variation of this is the stories of embarrassing yet totally inconsequential "scandals" about a candidate that involve nothing illegal or improper, but supposedly define the candidate as a person.

## The Headline Ends in a Question Mark

* Sometimes they'll mix things up and instead of question marks just use "may" or "might" or "rumored to" in the title. It accomplishes the same thing:

## The Headline Contains the Word "Blasts"

* Like the gaffes, this, too, is a cycle. Any politician can get a crowd of microphones in front of him by "blasting" the president or a candidate or whoever else is a big target for blasting. Then, the crowd of microphones will all rush off to whoever got blasted, and get them to blast back. Or "lash" back:

## The Headline Is About a "Lawmaker" Saying Something Stupid
  
* when the people making the controversial comments don't actually hold political power, the pundits and politicians have to invent a position for them

## The Headline Includes the Phrase "Blow To"

* It also gets phrased in the other direction. Congress passes a cut in payroll taxes. That's good news for the people paying the taxes, right? Nope, it's a "victory for Obama."
